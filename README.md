### DBH5

DBH5 is a class for using the HTML5 browser storage, it stores the key/value pairs as
key for page, value as JSON Array document.  There have been some updates made since I
released this file with my powertech tools, minor fixes and and an AngularJS front end 
to test it out.  The storage limit should be 5-10Mb depending on your browser and settings

### Browser Storage Options

By default this class is designed to use the localStorage, but you can override it with

> dbh5.db = sessionStorage;

Before calling a function in this class.  take a look at the example used in the index.html
